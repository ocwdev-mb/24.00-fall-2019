Please choose one of the following questions to answer. Please type out the question you are answering at the top of your paper. The paper should be 1,000-to-1,200 words and is due during session 15. 

1.  Jackson aims to establish, by way of his Knowledge Argument, that the world has nonphysical features. Reconstruct and assess this argument (you may wish to discuss Churchland’s criticism of it).
2.  Mackie gives two arguments for a claim he calls “moral skepticism.” Explain what “moral skepticism” is in Mackie’s sense. Which of the two arguments do you find most plausible? Reconstruct and assess the argument.
3.  Explain the doctrine of determinism. Do you think it is compatible with free will? If yes, respond to Van Inwagen’s argument for _incompatibilism_, if no, respond to Frankfurt’s argument for _compatibilism_.
4.  Explain in your own words Strawson’s argument for why there could be no true moral responsibility. What do you think the best objection is to this argument? Is it compelling? If not, why not?
5.  If you’d like to write about something else, please consult with your TA.
