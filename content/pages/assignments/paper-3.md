Please choose one of the following questions to answer. Please type out the question you are answering at the top of your paper. The paper should be 1,000-to-1,200 words and is due during session 18.

1.  What is _personal fission_? Is it the sort of process that we can survive? What does Parfit say about fission? Is he right? Why or why not?
2.  Williams breaks down a fission case into a number of steps. He argues that at no stage does it make sense to start thinking that the _A-bodied person_ is no longer _A_. If you were to argue that at some stage it _does_ makes sense to think that the _A-bodied person_ is no longer _A_, which stage would you pick? How would you respond to Williams’ argument against the plausibility of this judgment?
3.  If you wish you can write on a paper topic from the {{% resource_link be0dff92-b611-db3e-4c37-154c239d0f82 "second paper assignment" %}} that you did not already write about.
4.  If you’d like to write about something else, please consult with your TA.
